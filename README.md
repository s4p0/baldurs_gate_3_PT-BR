# Baldur's Gate 3 Portuguese (BR) translation resource
Baldur's Gate 3 resources files translated to portuguese (Brazil)

Indeed, that works!
Just needed rename all folders/files and re-compress it into a ```.pak``` package.
Now, you can use ```Portuguese``` on your ```.lsx``` and keep Spanish locale.


I've used [ExportTool](https://github.com/Norbyte/lslib) to export (and after to compress it too) the translation files (the Spanish one, in this case) to create a Portuguese-BR.

For now, I've changed the game to Spanish (but with my compressed files), but I'm pretty sure a new ```Portuguese``` folder would work just fine with the game.
To work it properly, you have to change the locale in ```.lsx``` file.
